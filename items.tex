\section{Potential items not covered in \gls{Operations}} \label{sec:items}

In the November 2023 DMvF2F several items were identified as not falling in \gls{DM} scope.
There are other items which have appeared on the summit, are useful, but have unclear owners in operations.
SITCOM is also building more functionality with no clear owner/maintainer in operations.

This is a list of some of these items which a summit \gls{software} team might improve and maintain:

\subsection{ RubinTV }
 this has been developed in \gls{SITCOM}, there have been no reviews and there is a sole maintainer

\subsection{ Summit \gls{QA} tools}
 - as they build up who maintains them

\subsection{ Reporting }

\subsection{ \gls{Camera} Visualization}
 - Tony built a tool for previewing camera images - is this going to be on the summit ? Who maintains it ? \gls{Camera} ?

\subsection{ \gls{OCPS} }
- written by \gls{DM} but not obviously a \gls{DM} maintenance job

\subsection{ Header Service }
- again \gls{DM} put this in place as it was  needed but it was not really \gls{DM} functionality

\subsection{ Exposure Log}
 - this has been ill defined and worked on by many

\subsection{ Exposure Log  insertion at \gls{USDF}}
 - this probably  should be \gls{USDF}

\subsection{ \gls{EFD}}
 - this is the biggest item provided by \gls{DM} - it should probably stay with SQuaRE but \gls{DM} was never sized for 24/7 support.
