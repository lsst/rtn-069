\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
As we approach operations of \VRO we need to take stock of our \gls{software} items.
Many tools have been developed which were not well specified in requirements, some examples are listed in \secref{sec:items}.
Some have been developed by \gls{DM} and some within \gls{SITCOM}.
Most of these appear ont eh summit (a location \gls{DM} was never intended to have a large foot print).


We feel a new team, possibly titled \emph{summit software team}, is needed to take care of these items.
This would require some new effort and reposition some currecnt staff.
